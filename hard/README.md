# DipTrace schematics and PCB design

Yeah, I know, the capacitors polarity is inverted everywhere on the schematic. But at least it's consistently inverted and for small ceramic caps as these it doesn't matter anyway ;-)

TODO:
* USB power supply
* Start using microcontroller with USB host interface
* LiPo rechargable battery
* Charger for the battery
* Speaker or buzzer for sound effects
* Power on/off for screen and sound system
* Measure the power supply in the deep sleep mode and if consumption permits avoid using the main power switch
* May be add one more "menu" button
